# Exposing the Limits of Video-Text Models through Contrast Sets

Repository for [Exposing the Limits of Video-Text Models through Contrast Sets](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H_Wx_yQfBZq) (NAACL Short 2022).

## Updates
6/24/2022: Released contrast sets for MSRVTT. 

To Do:
 - Release contrast sets for LSMDC
 - Release code to generate contrast sets automatically

## Code
TBD

## Data
We share the verb phrase based contrast set for [MSRVTT](http://ms-multimedia-challenge.com/2017/dataset) and [LSDMC-ID](https://sites.google.com/site/describingmovies/) in this repository.
Code to generate the contrast set will be released soon.

| Dataset   | Link | Contrast Set Type        |
|--------|:-----------:|-------------|
| MSRVTT      | [Data](https://github.com/jamespark3922/video-lang-contrast-set/tree/master/msrvtt)   | Verb Phrase |
| LSMDC       | TBD         | Verb Phrase |

### MSRVTT 
The verb based contrast sets generated by language model and humans can be found in `msrvtt/`.
You can find the video and annotation data following this [link](https://github.com/m-bain/frozen-in-time#-finetuning-benchmarks-msr-vtt). The sets are generated for the test set of MSRVTT.

You can additionally refer to download script in [CLIPBert](https://github.com/jayleicn/ClipBERT/blob/main/scripts/download_msrvtt.sh) to get the annotation data. To just get training and validation annotation, you can also run the download script:

```
bash msrvtt/download_msrvtt_train_val.sh
```
